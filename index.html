        <h4>Q1.What is React? What are its features</h4>
        <li>A.React was created by Jordane Walke,a software engineer at facebook in the year 2011 and
            it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram.
            React is a open source frontend js library.
            It follows the component based approach for building reusable UI component specially for single page
            application
            abd it is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.
        </li>
        <li>featuresof React-Virtual Dom</li>
        <li> one way data binding</li>
        <li>reusablecomponent</li>
        <li>JSX(Javascript syntax Extension)</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <h4>Q.Explain Virtual Dom</h4>
        <li> DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM,
            which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first
            time.
            <li>whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time.</li>
            <li>Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will
            get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept
            known Virtual DOM.</li> 
            <li>So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting
            of react component so it is a copy of your real dom.</li>
             <li>Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes,updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check
            for the new changes.
            <li>This complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom.
            this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>
            <h4>REact vs Angular vs Vue</h4>
            <li>
                Library is a set of reusablefunctions used by computer program and framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project,code calls the library bt in framework call the code.</li>
                <li>In library we can control the dat flow bt methods but in framework we dont haev any control of the data flow,framework decides how the data will flow that is nothing but frameworks calls the code,</li>
                <li>and in performance wise react is having higher performanceover angular and vue and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and it hs having SPA(single page application).
            </li>
            <h4>What is the difference between Class Component and Functional Component</h4>
            <li>In Class component use lifecycles method where as in functional component have hooks</li>
            <li>Functional components are also called stateless component while class component is called statefull component and there is no render function.</li>
            <li>In functional component returns value.and it accepts props as an argument but props and state can use in class components.</li>
            <li>Functional componentsare easy o read bt where in class component it is hard to read and have complex code structure.</li>
            <li>In class component we use the "this " keyword bt in class we don't use.</li>
            <h4>Statefull and Stateless component</h4>
            <li>Stateless component doesn't hold or manage state bt statefull component hold and can manage state.Stateless is simple and easy to understand where as statefull component it is complex as compare to the stateless componen</li>
            <li>Stateless component doesn't work with react lifecycles but where as statefull work with any hooks</li>
            <li>Stateless cann't be used bt statefull component we can use with the useState hooks</li>
            <li>Stateless component also known as functional component and statefull is a class component.</li>
            <h4>What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?</h4>
            <li>1. Intial Phase 2.Mounting 3.Updating 4.Unmounting </li>
            <li>In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
                1.	Initial Phase
                2.	Mounting Phase
                3.	Updating Phase
                4.	Unmounting Phase
                Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
            </li>

            <h4>What is Single Page Application or SPA? Explain the difference between SPA and MPA</h4>
                <li>In terms of speed and performance SPA no reloading is needed that is equal to high speed and responsive</li>
                <li>MPA which is having slow speed and performance is affected by reloading</li>
                <li>According to coding reusablecode for SPA </li>
                <li>Coding from scratch and no reusablity</li>
                <li>According to maintainance SPA is having fast and easy maintainance</li>
                <li>According to MPA maintainanceis required for each page</li>
                <li>According to SEO SPA is having limited optimization </li>
                <li>Accordingto user experience SPA is smooth and friendly</li>
                <li>MPA user experience is bad</li>
                <li>THere is no loading time required for SPA</li>
                <li>According to security wise SPA secures only end point but not safer,MPA secures end to end</li>
            <h4>What is the differencebetween State and props</h4>
                <li>State Changes can be asynchronous</li>
                <li>Props can be read only and use to communication between components</li>
                <li>Props can be accessed by child componentbut state cann't</li>
                <li>State can be used to change render dynamic changes with in component</li>
                <li>Props are immutable where as state are not immutable</li>
                <li>Props are external and controls by wheneverrender the components</li>
                <li>Stateis internal and controls by react components itself</li>
            <h4>EXplain props drilling concept and state uplifting</h4>
                <li>props drilling is basically a situation in the same data is been sent it to alomost every level due to the requirement in the final level</li>
                <li>when we have to share the same data across multiple child components then define the data into the parent</li>
                <li>Every component in react has it's own state because of this sometimes data can be reabundant and inconsistant so by lifting of state of the 
                    parent component as a single source of truth and passed the data of the parent in it's children</li>
            <h4>What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?</h4>
                <li>In the react component in controlled component data is controll by the react component or parent component also </li>
                <li>Data is control by the DOM in uncontrolled component</li>
                <li>controlled component allows validation controll ,where as uncontrolled it doesn't allows validation control</li>
                <li>In control it has better control over the forms and data</li>
                <li>In control component limited control on the forms and data</li>
            <h4>What is React Router</h4>
                <li>React router is standard library for routing in react it enables the navigation among the views of various componentin react application .
                    It allow changing the browser URL</li>
                <li>React router place an imp role to display multiple views within a SPA</li>

            <h4>How to create Reusable components in React?</h4>
                <li>Through the props method,using parent component</li>
            <h4>What are the three principles that Redux follows?</h4>
                <li>Single source of truth</li>
                <li>state is read only </li>
                <li>changes are made with pure functions</li>
            <h4>Explain difference between Browser Route, Route, Routes</h4>
                <li>BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API to keep our UI in sync with the url. It is the parent component that is used to store all the other components.</li>
                <li>Routes : It is the new component introduced in the V6 and a upgrade of a component. It is used to group all the route if there are more than 1 route components and routes are chosen based on best match.
                </li>
                <li>Route-It is the condiionally  shown component that renders some UI when path is matched to current URL</li>
                
        </ul>
