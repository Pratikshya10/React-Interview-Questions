    <ul>
        <h4>Q1.What is React? What are its features</h4>
        <li>A.React was created by Jordane Walke,a software engineer at facebook in the year 2011 and
            it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in facebook and instagram.
            React is a open source frontend js library.
            It follows the component based approach for building reusable UI component specially for single page
            application
            abd it is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application.

        <li>reusablecomponent</li>
        <li>JSX(Javascript syntax Extension)</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <h4>Q.Explain Virtual Dom</h4>
        <li> DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM,
            which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first
            time.
            <li>whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time.</li>
            <li>Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will
            get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept
            known Virtual DOM.</li> 
            <li>So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting
            of react component so it is a copy of your real dom.</li>
             <li>Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes,updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check
            for the new changes.
            <li>This complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom.
            this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>
            <h4>REact vs Angular vs Vue</h4>
            <li>
                Library is a set of reusablefunctions used by computer program and framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a project,code calls the library bt in framework call the code.</li>
                <li>In library we can control the dat flow bt methods but in framework we dont haev any control of the data flow,framework decides how the data will flow that is nothing but frameworks calls the code,</li>
                <li>and in performance wise react is having higher performanceover angular and vue and community support and also react is having the easy learning curve and it hs having SPA(single page application).
            </li>
            <h4>What is the difference between Class Component and Functional Component</h4>
            <li>In Class component use lifecycles method where as in functional component have hooks</li>
            <li>Functional components are also called stateless component while class component is called statefull component and there is no render function.</li>
            <li>In functional component returns value.and it accepts props as an argument but props and state can use in class components.</li>
            <li>Functional componentsare easy o read bt where in class component it is hard to read and have complex code structure.</li>
            <li>In class component we use the "this " keyword bt in class we don't use.</li>
            <h4>Statefull and Stateless component</h4>
            <li>Stateless component doesn't hold or manage state bt statefull component hold and can manage state.Stateless is simple and easy to understand where as statefull component it is complex as compare to the stateless componen</li>
            <li>Stateless component doesn't work with react lifecycles but where as statefull work with any hooks</li>
            <li>Stateless cann't be used bt statefull component we can use with the useState hooks</li>
            <li>Stateless component also known as functional component and statefull is a class component.</li>
            <h4>What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?</h4>
            <li>1. Intial Phase 2.Mounting 3.Updating 4.Unmounting </li>
            <li>In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
                1.	Initial Phase
                2.	Mounting Phase
                3.	Updating Phase
                4.	Unmounting Phase
                Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
                </li>
